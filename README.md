# Simple-Digit-recognition
Simple digit recognition algorithm using SFML lib (image processing) and FANN-library for implementing artificial neural network.
If you don't want to train net to export .data file for you, i've included it in the NumberSamples folder ("digitRecognition.net").
Please also note, that for training process the file "Numbers.data" is essential!
